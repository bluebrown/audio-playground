# Audio API Playground

The idea of this project is to provide an interactive environment to explore the various audio nodes. New component's can be created from a drop down list and the different inputs, outputs and parameters can be connected and disconnected via mouseclick. Different component settings can be tweaked via slider and select inputs.
